### Step 1: Economic Impact Analysis
**Performed by: Economist**

#### Task 1.1: Assess the potential impact of AGI on global labor markets.
- **Source:** [Potential Labor Market Impacts of Artificial Intelligence: An Empirical Analysis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/07/10/potential-labor-market-impacts-of-artificial-intelligence-an-empirical-analysis/)
- **Summary:** The report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) highlights that AGI could lead to significant job displacement in certain sectors, particularly those involving routine and manual tasks. However, it also suggests that AGI could create new job opportunities in tech-driven industries and roles that require human creativity and emotional intelligence. The net impact on employment will depend on the pace of AGI adoption and the ability of the workforce to adapt to new roles.

#### Task 1.2: Evaluate the possible changes in global economic structures and industries.
- **Source:** [Modeling the global economic impact of AI | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/notes-from-the-AI-frontier-modeling-the-impact-of-ai-on-the-world-economy)
- **Summary:** McKinsey's analysis indicates that AGI could lead to radical changes in global economic structures. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and finance are expected to undergo significant transformations due to increased automation and efficiency. AGI could also enable the creation of entirely new industries and business models, leading to a shift in the global economic landscape.

#### Task 1.3: Analyze the potential for economic inequality and shifts in wealth distribution.
- **Source:** [How Artificial Intelligence Could Widen the Gap Between Rich and Poor Nations - IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2020/12/02/blog-how-artificial-intelligence-could-widen-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor-nations)
- **Summary:** The IMF report suggests that AGI could exacerbate economic inequality both within and between countries. Advanced economies with higher levels of technological infrastructure and investment in AI are likely to benefit more, potentially widening the gap with developing nations. Within countries, there could be a growing divide between high-skilled workers who can leverage AGI and low-skilled workers who may face job displacement.

#### Task 1.4: Predict the impact on global trade and international relations.
- **Source:** [The impact of artificial intelligence on international trade - Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-international-trade/)
- **Summary:** Brookings' analysis indicates that AGI could have profound effects on global trade and international relations. AGI-driven automation could reduce the comparative advantage of low-wage countries in manufacturing, leading to shifts in global trade patterns. Additionally, countries that lead in AGI development could gain significant geopolitical influence, potentially leading to new alliances and tensions.

### Step 2: Workplace and Societal Impact Analysis
**Performed by: WhiteCollarWorker**

#### Task 2.1: Examine the potential changes in workplace dynamics and job roles.
- **Source:** [The impact of artificial intelligence on employment: the role of ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02647-9)
- **Summary:** Advances in AGI are expected to significantly alter workplace dynamics and job roles. Intelligent robots and AI systems can perform tasks that were previously done by humans, leading to a shift towards more strategic and creative roles for human workers. This transformation will require organizations to adapt their structures and workflows to integrate AGI effectively.

#### Task 2.2: Assess the impact on job security and employment rates.
- **Source:** [The impact of artificial intelligence on employment: the role of ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02647-9)
- **Summary:** The impact of AGI on job security and employment rates is complex and multifaceted. While AGI can lead to job displacement in certain sectors, it can also create new opportunities in others. The net effect on employment will depend on various factors, including the pace of AGI adoption, the ability of workers to reskill, and the creation of new industries and job roles.

#### Task 2.3: Evaluate the need for new skills and training programs.
- **Source:** [Best Artificial Intelligence Courses Online with Certificates [2024 ...](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=artificial+intelligence)
- **Summary:** The rise of AGI will necessitate a significant investment in new skills and training programs. Workers will need to develop expertise in areas such as machine learning, data analysis, and AI ethics. Online courses and certification programs can play a crucial role in equipping the workforce with the necessary skills to thrive in an AGI-driven economy.

#### Task 2.4: Analyze the potential societal changes, including shifts in work-life balance and mental health implications.
- **Source:** [Artificial intelligence in positive mental health: a narrative review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10982476/)
- **Summary:** AGI has the potential to bring about significant societal changes, including shifts in work-life balance and mental health implications. On one hand, AGI can enhance productivity and reduce the burden of repetitive tasks, potentially leading to a better work-life balance. On the other hand, the rapid pace of change and the need for continuous learning may contribute to stress and mental health challenges. It is essential to address these issues proactively to ensure a positive societal impact.
